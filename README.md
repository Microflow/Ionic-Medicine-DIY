I purchased this product because I got desperate. I have a lot of inflammation & joint issues. 

I have used this product three times thus far (every three days for 30 mins) & each time the colors & particles were the same. However, none were as disgusting as the first treatment (Tx). The first Tx scared the crap out of me. It was so gross!! Well they're all gross lol, but the water was so much more muddier in the first Tx.

The only thing I do not recommend is giving yourself a Tx at night lol. I did my first Tx around 7pm. Big mistake because it gave me way too much energy. There it was roughly 9pm & I was still reorganizing my bathroom & rearranging my bedroom LOL. I plan to do a Tx every three days for five weeks. Then maybe go to once a week or so, depending on what my body tells me.
