I purchased this product because I got desperate. I have a lot of inflammation & joint issues. 

I have used this product three times thus far (every three days for 30 mins) & each time the colors & particles were the same. However, none were as disgusting as the first treatment (Tx). The first Tx scared the crap out of me. It was so gross!! Well they're all gross lol, but the water was so much more muddier in the first Tx.

The only thing I do not recommend is giving yourself a Tx at night lol. I did my first Tx around 7pm. Big mistake because it gave me way too much energy. There it was roughly 9pm & I was still reorganizing my bathroom & rearranging my bedroom LOL. I plan to do a Tx every three days for five weeks. Then maybe go to once a week or so, depending on what my body tells me.

### Electrolytes

Electrolytes are ionic compounds that are:

- in the molten state (heated so they become liquids), or
dissolved in water
- Under these conditions, the ions in electrolytes are free to move within the liquid or solution.

#### Electrolysis is a process in which electrical energy, from a direct current (dc) supply, breaks down electrolytes. The free moving ions in electrolytes are attracted to the oppositely charged electrodes which connect to the dc supply.

### Electrodes and ions

##### The negatively charged electrode in electrolysis is called the cathode. Positively charged ions move towards the cathode.

##### The positively charged electrode in electrolysis is called the anode. Negatively charged ions move towards the anode.

- Two electrodes connected to a cell. 

- The negative electrode attracts positive ions and the positive electrode attracts negative ions.

- Ions move towards their oppositely charged electrode

### Products of electrolysis

When ions reach an electrode, they gain or lose electrons. As a result, they form atoms or molecules of elements:

- positive ions gain electrons from the negatively charged cathode
- negative ions lose electrons at the positively charged anode

#### Molten lead bromide, PbBr2(l), is an electrolyte. During electrolysis:

- Pb2+ ions gain electrons at the cathode and become Pb atoms
- Br- ions lose electrons at the anode and become Br atoms, which pair up to form Br2 molecules

* So lead forms at the negative electrode and bromine forms at the positive electrode.*

- Molten lead(II) bromide heated in beaker while electrodes inserted. Positive lead ions are attracted to the negative electrode, while negative 
bromide ions are attracted to the positive electrode.
